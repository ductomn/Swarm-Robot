/**
 * Library for state machine
 * 
 * This (state_machine.h) and coop.h, are libraries where 
 * all written drivers are used to do something.
 * 
 * Each function represents a state. Obstacle avoidance is run
 * all the time, except for some states. 
 * 
 * Some algorithms simulates calling helpers. The robots go around
 * randomly and someone starts sending messages (COMMANDx_SIG).
 * The robots do tasks based on received messages and after a while
 * goes back to random walk. The leader can be determined beforehand
 * or randomly. For determining leader beforehand set macro 
 * WITH_LEADER to "1" in io_define.h.
 * 
 * Other algorithms runs right after turning on (CHAIN, COMMAND3/FOLLOW_CHAIN). 
 * These algorithm needs to have some conditions fulfilled to work,
 * and these conditions can't be fulfilled while in random walk.
 * To turn on these algorithms set corresponding macros to "1". 
 * 
 * COMMAND3 can be run after random walk, but has a high chance 
 * for failure.
 * 
 * state_chain is implemented in coop.h, coop.c.
